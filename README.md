### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, welcome to my GitHub page!

If you've managed to find me here, you're probably interested in what I do. I am currently studying Computer Science and Neuroscience, among other things, at Harvard with the hopes of pursuing further education and a career in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. 

Specifically on GitHub, you can find my collection of technical projects and work, more generally. 

To learn more about me via other perspectives, find me on:<br>
