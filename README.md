### ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, welcome to my GitHub page!

If you've managed to find me here, you're probably interested in what I do. I am currently studying Information Systems and Data Science, among other things, at Cornell Tech with the hopes of pursuing a career in the fields of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and natural language processing. I am a proud alumna of Harvard, where I received a Computer Science degree in May 2024.

Specifically on GitHub, you can find my collection of technical projects and work, more generally. 

To learn more about me via other perspectives, find me on:<br>
